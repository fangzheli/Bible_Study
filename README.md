# Bible_Study
In this project, we will use a sentence transformer model to generate the embeddings of King James Version Bible verses, try to dig the similarity between different verses and make recommendations according to the input verses, which may be very helpful to both Christians and non-believers who want to know more about the Christianity to read the context within the Bible. Some annotated data from crowd sourcing will be used as the ground truth. Several discoveries are made on the characteristics of the Bible. We also use the similarities calculated by the embeddings generated by the sentence transformer model to rerank the verse recommendations to let it catch allusions relation.
